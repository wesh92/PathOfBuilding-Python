# PathOfBuilding-Python
Modern Python Port of Path of Building

## Goals

- Full, feature completeness as found in the LUA source.
- Regular updates in conjunction with the LUA source.
- Regular team of maintainers.
- Increased modularity to allow for plugin availability with a more "typical" language (LUA good but let's be honest more people are comfortable with Python).
- It's a good exercise for me!

## Tools Used And Recommended

- Poetry (**Required**), a modern virtual environment manager and dependency resolver.
- Pyenv (*Recommended*), a tool used to manage multiple python versions. While we will target Python 3.12.7 to begin with version updates will be important as well as backtesting and this makes it a little easier.
- Black/Ruff (**Required**), 2 opinionated formatter/linters.

## Contributions

Early stages of development will be an ongoing process of refining how we best work with one another. PRs are encouraged and welcomed but please familiarize yourself with the CONTRIBUTING.md document as well as the CODE_STYLE.md document as they should be treated as living documentation that is the culmination of discussions.
